# hm2mqtt

Reads Hame energy storage MQTT data, parses it and exposes it as JSON.

## Overview

hm2mqtt is a bridge application that connects Hame energy storage devices (like the B2500 series) to Home Assistant (or other home automation systems) through MQTT. It provides real-time monitoring and control of your energy storage system directly from your Home Assistant dashboard.

## Supported Devices

- B2500 series (e.g. Marstek B2500-D, Greensolar, BluePalm, Plenti SOLAR B2500H, Be Cool BC2500B)
  - First generation without timer support
  - Seconds and third generation with timer support
- Marstek Venus

## Prerequisites

- Before you start, you need a local MQTT broker. You can install one as a Home Assistant Addon: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#setting-up-a-broker
- After setting up an MQTT broker, configure your energy storage device to send MQTT data to your MQTT broker:
  1. For the **B2500**, you have two options:
     1. Contact the support and ask them to enable MQTT for your device, then configure the MQTT broker in the device settings through the PowerZero or Marstek app.
     2. With your an Android Smartphone or with a Bluetooth enabled PC use [this tool](https://tomquist.github.io/hame-relay/b2500.html) to configure the MQTT broker directly via Bluetooth. **Make sure you write down the MAC address that is displayed in this tool or in the Marstek app! You will need it later on and the WIFI MAC address of the battery is the wrong one.**
   
     **Warning:** Enabling MQTT on the device will disable the cloud connection. You will not be able to use the PowerZero or Marstek app to monitor or control your device anymore. You can re-enable the cloud connection by installing [Hame Relay](https://github.com/tomquist/hame-relay#mode-1-storage-configured-with-local-broker-inverse_forwarding-false) in Mode 1.
  2. The **Marstek Venus** doesn't officially support MQTT. However, you can install the [Hame Relay](https://github.com/tomquist/hame-relay) in [Mode 2](https://github.com/tomquist/hame-relay#mode-2-storage-configured-with-hame-broker-inverse_forwarding-true) to forward the Cloud MQTT data to your local MQTT broker.

## Installation

### As a Home Assistant Add-on (Recommended)

The easiest way to use hm2mqtt is as a Home Assistant add-on:

1. Add this repository URL to your Home Assistant add-on store:
   
   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftomquist%2Fhm2mqtt)
2. Install the "hm2mqtt" add-on
3. Configure your devices in the add-on configuration
4. Start the add-on

### Using Docker

#### Pre-built Docker Image

You can run hm2mqtt using the pre-built Docker image from the GitHub package registry:

```bash
docker run -d --name hm2mqtt \
  -e MQTT_BROKER_URL=mqtt://your-broker:1883 \
  -e MQTT_USERNAME=your-username \
  -e MQTT_PASSWORD=your-password \
  -e POLL_CELL_DATA=false \
  -e POLL_EXTRA_BATTERY_DATA=false \
  -e POLL_CALIBRATION_DATA=false \
  -e DEVICE_0=HMA-1:your-device-mac \
  ghcr.io/tomquist/hm2mqtt:latest
```
**your-device-mac** has to be formatted like this: 001a2b3c4d5e  (no colon and all lowercase). It's the one mentiond before!

Configure multiple devices by adding more environment variables:

```bash
# Example with devices using different firmware versions:
docker run -d --name hm2mqtt \
  -e MQTT_BROKER_URL=mqtt://your-broker:1883 \
  -e DEVICE_0=HMA-1:001a2b3c4d5e \
  -e DEVICE_1=HMA-1:001a2b3c4d5e \
  ghcr.io/tomquist/hm2mqtt:latest
```

The Docker image is automatically built and published to the GitHub package registry with each release.

### Using Docker Compose

A docker-compose example for a Marstek B2500-D V2:

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  hm2mqtt:
    container_name: hm2mqtt
    image: ghcr.io/tomquist/hm2mqtt:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - MQTT_BROKER_URL=mqtt://x.x.x.x:1883
      - MQTT_USERNAME=''
      - MQTT_PASSWORD=''
      - POLL_CELL_DATA=true
      - POLL_EXTRA_BATTERY_DATA=true
      - POLL_CALIBRATION_DATA=true
      - DEVICE_0=HMA-1:0019aa0d4dcb  # 12-character MAC address
```

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tomquist/hm2mqtt.git
   cd hm2mqtt
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default                 |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| `MQTT_BROKER_URL` | MQTT broker URL | `mqtt://localhost:1883` |
| `MQTT_CLIENT_ID` | MQTT client ID | `hm2mqtt-{random}`      |
| `MQTT_USERNAME` | MQTT username | -                       |
| `MQTT_PASSWORD` | MQTT password | -                       |
| `MQTT_POLLING_INTERVAL` | Interval between device polls (ms) | `60000`                 |
| `MQTT_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for device responses (ms) | `15000`                 |
| `POLL_CELL_DATA` | Enable cell voltage (only available on B2500 devices) | false |
| `POLL_EXTRA_BATTERY_DATA` | Enable extra battery data reporting (only available on B2500 devices) | false |
| `POLL_CALIBRATION_DATA` | Enable calibration data reporting (only available on B2500 devices) | false |
| `DEVICE_n` | Device configuration in format `{type}:{mac}` | -                       |

### Add-on Configuration

```yaml
pollingInterval: 60000  # Interval between device polls in milliseconds
responseTimeout: 30000  # Timeout for device responses in milliseconds
devices:
  - deviceType: "HMA-1"
    deviceId: "your-device-mac"
```

The device id is the MAC address of the device in lowercase, without colons.

**Important Note for B2500 Devices:**
- Use the MAC address shown in the Marstek/PowerZero app's device list or in the Bluetooth configuration tool
- **Important:** Do not use the WiFi interface MAC address - it must be the one shown in the app or Bluetooth tool

The device type can be one of the following:
- HMB-X: (e.g. HMB-1, HMB-2, ...) B2500 storage v1
- HMA-X: (e.g. HMA-1, HMA-2, ...) B2500 storage v2
- HMK-X: (e.g. HMK-1, HMK-2, ...) Greensolar storage v3
- HMG-X: (e.g. HMG-50) Marstek Venus

## MQTT Topics

### Device Data Topic

Your device data is published to the following MQTT topic:

```
hm2mqtt/{device_type}/device/{device_mac}/data
```

This topic contains the current state of your device in JSON format, including battery status, power flow data, and device settings.

### Control Topics

You can control your device by publishing messages to specific MQTT topics. The base topic pattern for commands is:

```
hm2mqtt/{device_type}/control/{device_mac}/{command}
```
