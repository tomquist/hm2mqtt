and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Next]

- Fix time synchronization to use local timezone offset (#98)


## [1.4.3] - 2025-06-22

- Jupiter: Add MPPT sensors for PV voltage, current, and power (#82)
- Jupiter: Add MPPT temperature, error, and warning sensors (#82)
- Jupiter: Fix BMS voltage, current, and temperature sensors by adding proper divisors (#82)
- Jupiter: Fix WiFi signal strength sensor (reverse sign and add dBm unit) (#82)
- Use `total_increasing` state class for Jupiter and Venus period energy sensors instead of `total` (#86, fixes #84)
- Jupiter: Add missing device and state classes to various sensors (#82)

## [1.4.2] - 2025-06-20

- Add configurable MQTT topic prefix in Home Assistant addon configuration (#78, fixes #72)
- Correct state class from incorrect type to proper monetary sensor state class (#81, fixes #80)
- Fix global availability topic to use correct path `hm2mqtt/availability` (#74)  

## [1.4.1] - 2025-06-07

- Add support for Jupiter C

## [1.4.0] - 2025-06-07

### Added

- Add support for Marstek Jupiter and Jupiter Plus (JPLS-8H) devices (#38)

### Fixed

- Venus: Fix version set and discharge power commands (#67, related to #60)
- Fix time period weekday bug when changing power settings via MQTT - weekdays would change unexpectedly when modifying power, start/end times, or enabled status (#65, fixes #61)
- MQTT proxy: Prevent all client ID conflicts (not just 'mst_' prefixed ones) to resolve connection issues with multiple devices (#64)

### Changed

- Add `state_class: 'measurement'` to power sensors for Home Assistant statistics and Energy Dashboard support (#66, fixes #62)
- MQTT proxy: Improved conflict resolution with retry logic and proper cleanup when clients disconnect (#64)

## [1.3.4] - 2025-05-27

- Add optional MQTT proxy server to workaround a bug in the B2500 firmware 226.5 or 108.7 which disconnects other devices when connecting multiple devices simultaneously. See [this issue](https://github.com/tomquist/hm2mqtt/issues/41) and read the [README](https://github.com/tomquist/hm2mqtt) for more information.
- Add more robust timeout handling: New setting `allowedConsecutiveTimeouts` to define the number of allowed timeouts before switching the device to offline.

## [1.3.3] - 2025-05-25

- Fix: Prevent overlapping device requests and ensure robust polling. Only send new requests if there is no outstanding response timeout for the device, set the response timeout before sending requests, and use a consistent key for lastRequestTime. This resolves issues with multi-device polling, especially for B2500 devices. (Closes #41)

## [1.3.2] - 2025-05-17

- B2500: Added Surplus Feed-in switch. This allows toggling surplus PV feed-in to the home grid when the battery is nearly full, via MQTT and Home Assistant.
- B2500: Fix unit and device class of Extra 2 battery SoC

## [1.3.1]

- Venus:
  - Fix working mode command
  - Add max charging/discharging power command
  - Add version command
  - Turn grid-type into read-only sensor
- B2500: Support setting output power to a value below 80W

## [1.3.0]

### Breaking Change

- Previously hm2mqtt published its own data to the `hame_energy/{deviceType}/` or `marstek_energy/{deviceType}` topic. From 1.3.0 onwards the topic changed to `hm2mqtt/{deviceType}`

### Added

- **B2500**: Better support for devices with firmware >=226 (for HMA, HMF or HMK) or >=108 (for HMJ):
  - Automatically calculate new encrypted device ID: No need to wait for 20 minutes to get the encrypted id. Instead, just enter the MAC address.
  - Remove the need to manually enter the topicPrefix
- **Venus**: Add BMS information sensors including:
  - Cell voltages (up to 16 cells)
  - Cell temperatures (up to 4 sensors)
  - BMS version, SOC, SOH, capacity
  - Battery voltage, current, temperature
  - Charge voltage and full charge capacity
  - Cell cycle count
  - Error and warning states
  - Total runtime and energy throughput
  - MOSFET temperature

## [1.2.0]

### Added

- Add support for configurable MQTT topic prefix per device (defaults to 'hame_energy') to support B2500 devices with firmware version >v226

## [1.1.2]

- B2500: Add support for devices of the HMJ series
- B2500: Fix incorrect battery capacity sensor unit for host and extra battery

## [1.1.1]

### Added

- Add sensors for when the data has last been updated

## [1.1.0]

### Added

- B2500: Add cell voltage sensors
- B2500: Add overall battery voltage and current sensors
- B2500: Add calibration information sensors
- Venus: Add wifi name sensor

### Fixed

- Venus Working Status now uses the correct mapping (thanks jbe)

## [1.0.7]

### Added

- B2500: Add total input and output power sensors

### Fixed

- Venus battery capacity

## [1.0.6]
